Problem Statement: Customer churn prediction
Customer churn is one of the most important metrics for a growing business to evaluate. While it's not the happiest measure, it's a number that can give your company the hard truth about its customer retention.

Customer churn is the percentage of customers that stopped using your company's product or service during a certain time frame.

This dataset provides us information of customers and the fact if they have converted into churn '1' or not '0'.

By making a prediction model for such dataset, we can predict if a customer is going to leave or not and what are the factor responsible for a customer churning.
